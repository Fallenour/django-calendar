===================================   Fork Notes Begin   ===================================

Currently, the application, while well developed, shows a potential for signs of modestly formed coding design, which is to be expected for an application designed for basic function. The application shows signs of non-modular design, and so therefore these capacities will be added to remediate this issue.

Tasks to be completed:

1. Make the application fully modular, so it can be easily integrated into any django application.
2. Make the application tiered, so any layer can be modified without substantial amounts of effort, as well as fully customizable.
3. As always, Credit the original author for a job well done.
